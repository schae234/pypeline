# Columns:
#   Contig:       Contig, chromosome, or feature for which a depth histogram was
#                 created. Unnamed features are named after the chromosome or
#             contig on which they are located, with a star appended. For
#             example "chr1*".
#   Size:     The total size of the region. Multiple features with the same
#             name are combined into one row, with the size representing to
#                  total of these. Note that overlapping bases are counted 2 (or
#                  more) times.
#  Hits:           Sum of SE, PE_1, and PE_2 hits
#  SE, PE_1, PE_2: Number of Single Ended, and Pair Ended (mate 1 and 2) hits overlapping
#                  the current contig or intervals. Note that a hit may be counted multiple
#                  times if it overlaps multiple intervals
#  Collapsed:      Number of hits for PE pair collapsed into a single read
#  M, I, D:        Number of aligned (M), inserted (I) and deleted (D) bases relative to references
#  Coverage:       Average number of bases covering each position in the contig(s)/intervals(s).
